# Automatic-Washing-Machine
PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This project implements a washing machine controller using Verilog HDL and simulates it in Xilinx Vivado. The design follows a finite state machine (FSM) approach, ensures managing different washing stages such as water filling, detergent addition, spinning and more . The system transitions between these states based on sensor inputs and timing constraints and enables smooth transitions between different stages while automating the washing process..

FEATURES:

✅ FSM-based state transitions for precise washing control

✅ Follows the standard washing process:

- Door Check
- Water Filling
- Detergent Addition
- Washing Cycle
- Draining Water 
- Spinning Clothes

✅ Control signals for valves, motor

✅ Simulated in Xilinx Vivado for functional verification
